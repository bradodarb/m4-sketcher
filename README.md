# M4Sketcher

This project is an attempt to pull apart some of the brilliant work over at [jsketcher](https://github.com/xibyte/jsketcher) and break it into discrete components so that it can be generally used within any application framework.


## Roadmap

* Move 2d code into separate components and remove any interdependencies
* Reimplement code using TypeScript to enable additional compile time testing
* Refactor and document code to make it easier to contribute to
* Build basic Angular components to test 2d sketcher libraries
* Migrate 2d Sketcher library to it's own code repository to remove NG dependencies


...future, add and refine tools for object creation
